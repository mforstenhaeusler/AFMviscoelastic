# AFMviscoelastic
AFMviscoelasticity is set of python libraries for scientific simulation, fitting and analysis of viscoelastic materials using atmoic force microscopy (AFM) meassuring techniques. It further provides examplementry excel sheets, jupyter notebooks and python code as supplemantory material demonstarting the use of the python functions provided in the libraries.
